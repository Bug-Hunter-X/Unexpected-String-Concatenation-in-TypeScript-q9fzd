This example demonstrates a potential issue in TypeScript where implicit type coercion can lead to unexpected string concatenation when using the + operator with numbers and strings. The `add` function is intended to add two numbers but accepts a string without a compile-time error, resulting in string concatenation instead of numerical addition. The solution showcases how to enforce type safety using type guards or by modifying the function signature to prevent such issues.
